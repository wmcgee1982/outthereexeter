        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Our purpose is to celebrate, promote and uplift the LGBTQIA+ community across Exeter
          through arts and culture. We do this by enabling emerging and existing LGBTQIA+ groups and
          individuals to highlight and showcase their work through an annual arts and culture festival and
          other means that support at least one of the following:
          <ul>
          <li>promoting the wellbeing of the Exeter LGBTQIA+ community</li>
          <li>improving the lives of Exeter LGBTQIA+ peoples</li>
          <li>enhancing the LGBTQIA+ culture across the Exeter community</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Our aims to enrich Exeter's LGBTQIA+ groups and all branches of the community across the
          city can be achieved through four tangible goals:
          <ol>
            <li>Foster stronger relationships between LGBTQIA+ members and the wider community</li>
            <li>Create and promote an LGBTQIA+ directory of groups, partners, mentors, programmes,
              and opportunities that support LGBTQIA+ people to thrive and connect them with
              relevant supportive resources and networks.</li>
            <li>Host an annual festival in collaboration with LGBTQIA+ organisations and individuals, to
              profile and raise awareness of the culture, support and opportunities available to the
              community.</li>
            <li>Provide year-round opportunities for LGBTQIA+ groups to build a sense of belonging,
              have a positive impact on the environment and make Exeter a more welcoming place to
              live, work and visit.</li>
